# 🌟 Shivam's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I showcase my work, projects, and skills. I built this portfolio to demonstrate my abilities as a developer and to provide a glimpse into my journey in the world of technology. 

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: 
  - Next.js (React Framework)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - HTML & CSS

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js (Next.js api in app router)
  - Nodemailer (for email functionality)

- **Cloud Services**:
  - Cloudinary (for image uploads)
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Vercel (for hosting)

## 💡 How I Built It

The journey of building this portfolio was both challenging and exciting. Here’s a brief overview of the steps I took:

1. **Planning**: 
   - I started by sketching the layout and deciding on the sections I wanted to include.
   - The key sections are: About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.

2. **Development**:
   - I set up the Next.js framework and integrated Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Each section was created as a separate component to keep the code organized and maintainable.
   - I implemented a contact form using Nodemailer to allow visitors to send me messages directly from the website.

3. **Styling**:
   - Tailwind CSS made it easy to create a responsive and modern design.
   - I focused on creating a clean and user-friendly interface.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Finally, I deployed my portfolio on Vercel, allowing it to be accessible to everyone online.

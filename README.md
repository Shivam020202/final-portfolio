## 💡 How I Built It

The journey of building this portfolio was both challenging and exciting. Here’s a brief overview of the steps I took:

1. **Planning**: 
   - I started by sketching the layout and deciding on the sections I wanted to include.
   - The key sections are: About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.

2. **Development**:
   - I set up the Next.js framework and integrated Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Each section was created as a separate component to keep the code organized and maintainable.
   - I implemented a contact form using Nodemailer to allow visitors to send me messages directly from the website.

3. **Styling**:
   - Tailwind CSS made it easy to create a responsive and modern design.
   - I focused on creating a clean and user-friendly interface.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Finally, I deployed my portfolio on Vercel, allowing it to be accessible to everyone online.
